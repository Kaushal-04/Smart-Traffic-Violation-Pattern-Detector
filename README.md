# Smart-Traffic-Violation-Pattern-Detector
Smart Traffic Violation Pattern Detector is a Python project that uses computer vision to detect helmetless riders and vehicles crossing zebra crossings at red signals. It extracts license plate numbers via OCR and stores violations with details in both a database and an SSV file for easy tracking.
